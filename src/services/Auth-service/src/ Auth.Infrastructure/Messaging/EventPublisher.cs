//publishes auth events to the message broker using azure service bus
// The EventPublisher.cs would use the Azure SDK for .NET to connect to Azure Service Bus and publish messages. You'd implement methods to:

// Connect to your Azure Service Bus namespace
// Create/manage topics for different event types
// Serialize event data to messages
// Send messages to the appropriate topics

// Other microservices (like your Group Management service) would then subscribe to these topics to receive notifications about authentication events.
// For example, when a user creates a chama group and needs to be assigned the "admin" role, your authentication service could publish a UserRoleChangedEvent to Azure Service Bus. The Groups microservice would subscribe to this event and update its own database accordingly.
// Azure Service Bus is a great choice for this architecture because it:

// Provides reliable message delivery
// Supports publish/subscribe patterns
// Has built-in dead-letter queues for failed messages
// Scales well as your system grows
// Integrates easily with other Azure services
